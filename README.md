# REHS2020

## Overview
The goal of this research project is to develop a set of Jupyter Notebooks that can be used to train users on the Comet supercomputer. These notebooks will be hosted on the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) GitHub.io training pages. The purpose of this project is to understand the basics of High Performance Computing, Jupyter Notebooks\cite{jupyter} and GitHub. For this, we worked with existing projects to develop new notebooks. The research components are to contribute to the body of knowledge needed for hosting live, dynamic, interactive services that interface to HPC systems, and to learn how to develop interactive notebooks to be used for education and training of the users of these systems. As a result of our efforts, we produced several new Jupyter Notebooks that will be used for Comet/SDSC training.
